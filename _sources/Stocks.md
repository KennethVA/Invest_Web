Stocks
======

Stocks, also known as shares or equities, represent partial ownership in a company. When you purchase a stock, you're buying a small piece of that company's assets and earnings. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Ownership**: Each stock represents a fraction of ownership in a company.

2. **Types**:
   - Common stocks: Offer voting rights and potential dividends
   - Preferred stocks: Usually offer fixed dividends but no voting rights

3. **Trading**: Stocks are bought and sold on stock exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

4. **Value**: Stock prices fluctuate based on various factors, including company performance, economic conditions, and market sentiment.

5. **Returns**: Investors can profit from:
   - Capital appreciation (increase in stock price)
   - Dividends (distribution of company profits)

6. **Risks**: Stock values can decrease, potentially leading to losses for investors.

Understanding stocks is crucial for building a diverse investment portfolio and participating in the growth of the global economy.
