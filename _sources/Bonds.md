Bonds
=====

Bonds are debt securities that represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower, typically a corporation or government entity. Here's what you need to know about bonds:

1. **Definition**: A bond is essentially an IOU where the issuer promises to pay back the principal with interest.

2. **Key Components**:
   - Face value (par value): The amount paid to the bondholder at maturity
   - Coupon rate: The interest rate paid by the issuer
   - Maturity date: When the principal is to be repaid

3. **Types**:
   - Government bonds (e.g., U.S. Treasuries)
   - Municipal bonds
   - Corporate bonds
   - Junk bonds (high-yield, higher risk)

4. **Trading**: Bonds can be traded on the open market, with prices fluctuating based on interest rates and the issuer's creditworthiness.

5. **Yields**: Bond yields move inversely to prices. As prices go up, yields go down, and vice versa.

6. **Risk vs. Return**: Generally considered lower risk than stocks, but also typically offer lower potential returns.

7. **Role in Portfolios**: Often used for income generation and to balance riskier investments.

Bonds play a crucial role in both individual investment portfolios and the broader financial system, offering a way to preserve capital while generating income.
